## Command line

The main commands of `docsite` are only three, mainly as follows:

### `docsite init`

Executing this command in the project root directory will initialize a site development template and install related dependencies in the directory.

### `docsite start`

Executing this command will start a development server locally with the port number `8080`. This page will also be automatically opened in the browser.

### `docsite build`

After the local development is completed, run this command to compile and build the source code and markdown document to generate the build file.
