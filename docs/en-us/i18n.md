## I18n

Internationalization is divided into two parts, namely the internationalization of the markdown document and the internationalization of the rest of the site.

### Internationalization of markdown documents

The markdown document is mainly divided into docs documents and blog documents. The internationalization of these two types of documents is similar, indicating that the documents are placed in the `zh-cn` and `en-us` directories in the `docs` directory according to the Chinese and English versions. The blog files are placed in the `zh-cn` and `en-us` directories in the `blog` directory according to the Chinese and English versions.

### Internationalization of the rest of the site

In the files of `site_config` directory, the Chinese and English versions correspond to the `zh-cn` and `en-us` fields respectively, and all page-related need to be configured under these two fields.
